# Project Context

This is a Chrome extension written in TypeScript. It runs on the MS Teams web client. It periodically polls the user's calendar for upcoming meetings. If there is any eligible meeting starting in the next 2 minutes, it plays a ringtone. The ringtone stops automatically 2 minutes after the meeting starts. It also adds a button to the top of the page the user may click to dismiss the ringing for that meeting. When the user joins a meeting, the extension stops ringing.
